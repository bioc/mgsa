clean ups after roxygen runs:
- remove double aliases. So far:
	\alias{show} entries in show,MgsaResults-method.Rd and in show,MgsaSets-method.Rd
- remove link to initialize in MgsaSets.
	Although it is not exported, a link is generated, maybe because there is a nonstandardGenericFunction for "initialize" defined from package "methods"initialize".

before doing R CMD check:
- remove *.o in src
